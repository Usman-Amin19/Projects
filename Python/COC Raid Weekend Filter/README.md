I was the co-leader in my clan and raid weekend was my responsibility<br>
Every weekend I had to go through each raid done and write down clan members' name<br>
on a paper and then I had to go through each clan member in clan<br>
and check they had done their raids or not. Hectic, right?<br>
Guess what I had to do it every weekend<br>

This code uses the API key from your COC developers account<br>
and get the current clan members,<br>
then the code gets the clan members who didn't completed<br>
their max possible raids(for now max raids possible are 6).<br>
It prints the raids done / maximum possible raids.<br>
the code also prints the members who didn't used any of their raid weekend raids separately.<br>
